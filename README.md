Please refer to the research paper published by our Research Group for more context: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3406596.

I am currently working on developing models for estimating energy consumption in Maximal Frequented Path Graphs.

Please install all the dependencies/libraries and then run the commands below:




```sh
command: pip install numpy==1.26.0
command: python mfpg_matrix.py --graph 1
command: python mfpg_matrix.py --graph 2
```
