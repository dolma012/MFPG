Matrix based approach to implement Maximal Frequented Path Graph given a spatial graph and energy data.

Please refer to the research paper published by the Research Group for more context: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3406596.

I am currently working on developing models for estimating energy consumption in Maximal Frequented Path Graphs.
